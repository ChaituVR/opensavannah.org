   Kevin Lawver is the Chief Technical Officer at Planted, where he helps connect people with jobs at startups using code. He’s the co-founder of <a href="https://techsav.co">TechSAV</a>, organizer of the local RailsBridge chapter, runs Refresh Savannah, helps out where he can, advises startups on all kinds of stuff, and likes to bake. As the first to join Open Savannah's advisory board, Kevin is a fierce advocate for better government technology, open data, and iterative processes that, he hopes, can help bridge the divide between citizen and city in Savannah and Chatham County.
