1. **Local government is (can be) what we do together.** Government can and should represent and serve the people in our communities, but it will only do that if we get involved and make it relevant to our communities’ needs.
2. **Change starts at the local level.** Starting with Savannah and Chatham County lets us connect directly with users and allows us to impact people’s lives faster.
3. **We envision local government beyond municipal borders**. The City of Savannah and Chatham County exist as interconnected, interdependent and abstract delineations that only lead to tribalism and inefficiency. To us, 'Savannah' doesn't just refer to the area within the city limits; it refers to the broader sense of place with which all Coastal Georgians identify as a region. Likewise, we think that unity and city-county consolidation will become necessary for the future of Savannah.
3. **We strive for impact at scale.** The two biggest levers for improving people’s lives at scale are technology and government--we put them together, to solve some of America’s biggest challenges. 
4. **We create change by doing**. We make the change we want to see real as fast as possible, building visible product, and building trust and buy-in as we deliver results. (The strategy is delivery? Show the thing?)
5.  **We create change through advocacy and collective action**. We aim to make *civics* sexy again. Civic illiteracy is often willful. We believe that by educating the public better as to how they can influence power as citizens in a democracy.
6.  **We show up**. All of civics is about 'who decides.' We believe that decisions are made by those show up. So to bring the change we want locally, we show up.
6.  **We believe in listening before building.**. Too often, civic innovation builds solutions for problems that aren't actually problems. We believe that to achieve change at scale and foster broad-based collective action, we must first *listen* to the needs of all citizens.
6.  **We put process before product**. We use technology, design, open data, art and locality knowledge merely as *modes* for civic empowerment. It is about the process of civic empowerment, not the product of civic-technology. If the application of civic-tech fails to empower citizens in a way that spurs action, it is useless. 
7.  **We believe that government is bigger than politics**. Politics and hyperpartisanship has perverted much of our collective view of government. But government is not the same as politics.
5. **We meet user needs**. We must also take care of government needs, like various forms of compliance, in order to do our work, but we privilege user needs, articulated through research with real people to understand their experiences, and ensure that services are designed to work for them.
6. **We are continuously improving**. We start small and get a working product into people's hands as early as possible, test with users frequently, and make continuous improvements based on feedback. (this could fall in with meet user needs). Every product remains perpetually in *beta*.
7. **We work in the open**. We build open source technology, we invite participation and feedback, and we share what we are learning along the way. While we always lean towards open, we are pragmatic enough to adopt a proprietary approach when it supports the safety of our users, or the outcomes that we seek.
8. **We support public servants to serve the public.** The choice to work in government is often a selfless one. We honor and those who work hard help people in their communities through government. Our job is to help them do that better, not here to replace them. We don't view bureaucracy ipso facto as a bad thing.
9. **Government should work for *all* Coastal Georgia residents**, not just those with access to power and resources. We define “citizen” as someone who shows up for their community, not by legal status. 
10. **Our organization and our community should reflect the diversity of the country.** The problems we face cannot be solved unless a greater number and diversity of people become involved in civic life and have input into critical community issues. 
11. **Government as a platform means working with a diverse ecosystem of partners and contributors** -- We partner with community based organizations and government institutions that have the expertise in the challenges that we are trying to solve, we know that we can't do this alone, and that we are stronger together.

**We help local government work for the people who need it most** -- We focus on improving services for the most vulnerable in our society. 

## We are Open Savannah.
